# AtliQ Sales Insights PowerBi Dashboard

This is a project I replicated from Codebasics PowerBi Youtube playlist. You can find the link of the playlist below.


## Problem statement

AtliQ hardware is a company which delivers computer hardware & peripheral 
Manufacturers to his clients, which has several branches throughout India. The sales director of the company is facing a lot of
issues in terms of understanding how the business is performing and what are all the problem company is
facing currently as the sales are not as expected and declining gradually. And whenever he calls the regional managers
to get the current status of the sales and market, as a human behaviour, these people 
sugar cote the truth and send tons of Excel files instead of disclosing the truth, which made the sales director more frustrated.
Humans are not comfortable in consuming numbers from excel files, which is obvious reason for the frustration.

## Solution 

Sales director of the AltiQ hardware, decided to build a PowerBI Dashboard for converting the data into 
visual representation to make data driven decisions. So, he hired a team of data people to complete this task.
